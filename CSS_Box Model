***** CSS positioning properties****
Positions : a) Static
            b) Relative
            c) Absolute
            d) Fixed
            
            Relative: The element becomes relative to what it would have been when static. Thus the changes in the element occur according to as it would have been statically.
            Absolute: The element becomes relative to the parent element rather than when it was static. For ex- when a <div> is in a <body> , the body acts as an parent to the div element.
                      Also, the usual left right top and bottom work differently when working with Absolute positioning as it moves the element compared to the margin of the Body/parent.
                      
                      
                      16 px = 100% = 1 em  // Font properties
                      
                      to center an Inline element or a block element whose width is specified we can simply use
                      for ex- <a></a>
                              a{
                               margin: auto;   //centers the element to the parent.
                              }
